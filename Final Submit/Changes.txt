Grade 2:
 
Changes:

	1. Changed names on association ie. Manage berths -> Manage
	2. Added more multiplicit expressions
	3. Merged "Sign up" and "log in information" to "Log in server"
	4. Removed "tresurer" 

Motivation:

1. After the feedback and disscusion in the group changes were made to give more consistency of the naming.

2. Due to changes of "berths" to "berth" we needed to add more correct multiplicit expressions since one secretary should be able to manage several berths.

3. From the feedback we recived we decided to merge "Sign up" and "log in information" because they were both managed the same role.

3/4. From disscusion and feedback we trimmed down the model by removing unnecessary information such as merging "Sign up" and "log in information" because they were both managed the same role.
     We also removed the "treasurer" because he was irrelevant in this scenario.


Grade 3:
 
Changes:

	5. Removed the three payment options since they are a part of the payment system and is then irrelevent. 
 
Motivation:

1,2,3. In the grade 3 model we have made the same changes as we did for grade 2 execpt number 4 because the tresurer is relevant in this scenario.
